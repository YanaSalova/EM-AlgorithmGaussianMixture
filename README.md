# EM-AlgorithmGaussianMixture
his repository implements the EM algorithm for estimating parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. Tasks include implementation, visualization, and verification. It uses the dmvnorm function from the mvtnorm package for multivariate normal densities. Visualize results with provided data, overlaying estimated densities.
